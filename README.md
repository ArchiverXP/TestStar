# TestStar
Some tweaks for the app, Video Star.


TO BUILD:

Download Theos either on a Mac or on Linux, then run make package.

It should be smooth sailing.


Only works on rootless A12+, this is mainly for my own usage.

You can try to compile it for A11 and below and pre-iOS 15, but this is untested.
